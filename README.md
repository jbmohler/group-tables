# Intro

This is a primitive exhaustive search type of tool for finding finite group
structures.  See https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Group.html for a definition of
group and the 4 axioms.

# Implementation

Building a finite group table by trial and error looks a bit like solving a
sudoku.  Every column and row must have exactly one of each element.  I've
grabbed some old sudoku solving code I had and adapted it to this exercise.
